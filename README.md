# Example React Native App

Companion React Native App for my [Serverless Lambda DynamoDB REST API
](https://github.com/KamiMoon/aws-serverless-learning) backend.

- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app). So all those commands for running apply.

Uses

- [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Native-Starter#typescript-react-native-starter) for funz since I have never used Typescript with React only ES6.
- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management.
- [Redux Form](https://redux-form.com/7.4.2/) for forms and client-side validation.
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) for mobile navigation.
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for Ajax including a Redux middleware: [Redux Axios Middleware](https://github.com/svrcekmichal/redux-axios-middleware).
- [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) for UI components.
